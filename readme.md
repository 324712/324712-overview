# 324712 Overview
A simple overview, manageable from a clear and uncluttered administration environment (not secured). Written fast and simple in PHP and MYSQLi. There is no demo of the administration environment on the demo, this is due to the security of the website as it is used topically.

### Easy to use
To use the system locally, modify the SCSS or use BrowserSync you can use the command `npm install`. If you are going to use it directly on a website this command is not necessary.
